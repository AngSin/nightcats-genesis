# About
Night Cats is a gaming NFT project. The genesis collection will have selected token IDs within it nominated 'God Cat'
status. A curse will be activated every weekend, during which, God cats will be able to kill the secondary collection
of Night Cats. The secondary collection can mint necklaces (another collection) to either protect themselves from the
'killing' or to resurrect them after they have been killed. 

Other genesis cat holders will also be able to mint these necklaces. To participate in a raffle.
- 1 Immunity necklace = 1 entry
- 1 Resurrection necklace = 3 entries

The winners of these raffle will be nominated as the God Cats for the next curse.

3 immunity necklaces can be burnt to mint a resurrection necklace
And 10 secondary night cats can be burnt to claim a genesis night cat
